# FIND PEAK ELEMENT 

'''
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# Examples
nums1 = [1,2,3,1]

nums2 = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
print(findPeakElement(nums2)) # Output: 5

nums3 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(findPeakElement(nums3)) # Output: 4

nums4 = [5,4,3,2,1]
print(findPeakElement(nums4)) # Output: 0

nums5 = [1,3,2,4,6,5]
print(findPeakElement(nums5)) # Output: 4

nums6 = [10,20,15,2,23,90,67]

nums7 = [1,1,1,1,1]

nums8 = [100,50,25,12,6]

nums9 = [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]

nums10 = [5,10,20,15,10,5]
